Fix schematic and pcb not consistent
Swap comparator input (Vref en inj current)
Lineup all components more nicely
Add leds for inj output
Remove leds for power 12V
Add cooling pads to transistors
Make 5volt regulator smd version
Remove safety zener 5V
Smaller diodes for ref voltage
REF voltage testpoints needed (with filter)
REf PWM led to visually see what the setpoint is
Capacitors on 12V to reduce peak currents and feedback
